\subsection*{Minicom Patch}
While working on
\href{https://github.com/AmateurECE/SerialBridge}{SerialBridge}, I noticed that
minicom doesn't actually check to ensure that the baud rate was set correctly.
I stumbled upon this while trying to set the baud rate of the serial port to
1.5Mbaud. Minicom reported that the interface supposedly \textit{was} operating
at 1.5Mbaud, however I was able to empirically confirm that it was in fact
\textit{not}. By digging through the source, I determined that the check should
go at the call to \mintinline{C}{ioctl} at
\href{https://github.com/Distrotech/minicom/blob/54202fe0ea8510dc8fcd23ab49d39d
  3d8cb2e529/src/sysdep1.c#L519}{line 519}:
\begin{minted}{C}
  ioctl(fd, TIOCSETP, &tty);
\end{minted}
