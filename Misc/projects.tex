\begin{abstract}
  This document is to serve as a declaration of intention. It outlines many of
  my larger projects, describing their goals, procedures \& workflows, and any
  other relevant information necessary to begin the project. This brief contains
  a simple list of projects, each with a number. That number is the
  corresponding section under which a more detailed description of the project
  can be found. Any entry which begins with the word \emph{(Undocumented)} in
  parentheses is included in the list, but not documented in further detail
  elsewhere in the document. This is usually temporary.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{(Undocumented)} \textbf{Femtofs} - Develop a small EEPROM based
    filesystem for the TIVA Board
  \item \emph{(Undocumented)} \textbf{Brew-inator} - An automatic beer brewing
    machine, built from scratch.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Develop an impeller pump system, which requires developing a
      homemade brushless DC motor and controller. Create a state diagram for the
      controller (Moore machine?) and design a test circuit for the controller.
      Then design and build the motor. Finally, use the motor to implement an
      impeller pump.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \emph{(Undocumented)} \textbf{Hey, Porter} - Computer system and intranet
    which implements ``smart-home'' technology. ``Hey, Porter'' will be the
    keywords which start the listener, much like ``OK, Google'', or ``Alexa''.
    It is named after the Johnny Cash song.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Utilize Google's speech-to-text engine, develop a microcontroller
      node which will communicate with the master node via Ethernet. Create a
      voice that has character, for once. Decision trees that affect
      pronunciation?
    \item Cannibalize a commercial PC motherboard, reverse-engineering the BIOS
      chip and replacing the BIOS and operating system with a compatible
      bootloader and custom-built OS or RTOS.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \emph{(Undocumented)} \textbf{Adviser} - (No, that's not a spelling
    mistake) Program which builds a schedule for a student.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Finish implementing the audit-JSON parser
    \item Implement the web-crawling facilities
    \item Implement the schedule building facilities
    \item Consider using a Flask App for delivery.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \emph{(Undocumented)} \textbf{Matlab Compiler} - Implement a basic
    MATLAB-target binary compiler, with a standard library written in Fortran \&
    C.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{abstract}
