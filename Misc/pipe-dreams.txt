# MATHEMATICS

*   Determine a mathematically accurate method for describing an algorithm.
    The purpose of this is to optimize and perfect interfaces and algorithms
    before translating them into source code. This has applications in
    scientific computing and operating systems research. I'm not convinced that
    I know the math yet to be able to do this, but we should be able to
    represent:
	- Algorithms and Data Structures BOTH as tuples, which have sets of
	inputs, sets of outputs, and functions which match inputs to outputs,
	as well as functions which relate the time and space complexity of
	the system.
	- The functions should be able to be represented in a common format
	which can be analyzed.
	- Data types of the inputs and outputs should be specified, but they
	should not be integral to the understanding of the system.
	- Pseudocode should NOT be necessary for understanding the system.
*   Research Linear Programming as a method for optimizing parallel computing.
*   Research using the discrete derivative of a vector of integers to determine
    the best algorithm to sort the vector. This will probably require examining
    the discrete derivative of the best and worst cases of many common types of
    sorting algorithms.

# PROGRAMMING
###

*   Fortran,C,Verilog - A constant time logarithm calculator (base 2).
*   Fortran,C - calculate the position of the stars in a constellation given a
    latitude, longitude, and date.
*   Fortran,C - A discrete Laplace transform.
*   Fortran,C - Determine a combination of resistors, capacitors, inductors, to
    achieve an exact or close approximation of an impedance.
*   Fortran,C - Program to convert an RC filter to an equivalent LC filter, and
    vice versa.
*   C - Create a parallel NFA with fork() and/or OpenMP.

# ENGINEERING

*   Compact Cluster - A compact, loosely coupled computing cluster that uses
    dynamically replaceable mezzanine compute modules. These modules should
    have a common form factor--for example, (SO-)DIMM--as well as their own
    dedicated private memory, but the system will provide shared memory. The
    individual modules should be invisible to the user. The operating system
    will provide a relatively simple scripting interface that will allow for
    custom work queues, scheduling, and symmetric processing.
*   Capacitive virtual joystick - This idea needs some refining. The gist is
    that I would like a way to translate motion of the thumb into vector
    motion, with a simple program API, so that this `virtual joystick' can be
    used to control things such as mice, remote-controlled devices, etc. One
    theory is to use a pair of differential three-axis accelerometers to
    measure acceleration in one axis. The control would be momentary--i.e.
    acceleration in one direction would cause a vector in that direction, but
    the vector will persist after the acceleration goes to zero. The vector
    not be zeroed until an equal and opposite acceleration is experience.
