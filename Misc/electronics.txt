1. This is Dr. Howard Johnson's "High-Speed Signal Propagation" text of mine
that u had borrowed for a while. I met Dr. Johnson at a conference out in CA a
# of yrs back. Got his autograph too. Nice guy, smart and very practical. Has a
knack for explaining difficult SI concepts and then practically applying them
to real-world problems and design.

2. This is the 1st edition of Dr. Johnson's high-speed digital design texts but
still has a ton of very useful and applicable info/theory. I still refer to it
often.

3. A great SI reference from Dr. Bogatin. Covers some subjects not covered by
Dr. Johnson. Looks at some things in Dr. Johnson's books from a different
angle. I took a seminar class of Dr. Bogatin's a # of yrs back out in CA.
Great, nice, down to earth guy. Gonna probably put this one on my Christmas
list this yr.

4. Here's a couple of references from Stephen Hall that look to b good but i
haven't specifically seen the books, just some sample text. I use to work with
Stephen when he was a summer intern at the Mayo Clinic. Didn't seem like the
technical, authoring kinda guy to me at the time but whatta i know.

(03:47:19 PM) etwardy-------------------: Thank you! Those are pretty cool
stories. It must have been funny for you when Stephen came out with a book,
haha. I don't know if any of these touch on it or not, but do you know any
books that do really in-depth semiconductor theory? Like deriving the
characteristic equations from differential equations and the like? I haven't
been able to find a resource that covers the math. Thanks again!

Hall's "Advanced Signal Integrity for High-Speed Digital Designs" is suppose to
b pretty mathy but i'm guessing it doesn't get down to the semiconductor level.
(10/20/2017 04:05:34 PM) Rick -----: i do have a text tho from one of my
college classes at the UW from way back when that might have some of the math
and diffy q at the semiconductor level that ur looking for. I'll put it on my
desk and u can take a look at ur leisure. It's a blue text titled "Analysis and
Design of Digital Integrated Circuits" by Hodges and Jackson.
