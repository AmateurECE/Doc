\title{``A Definitive List of Things''}

This document is a list of things, some of which I have learned already in the
course of my academic career, some of which I hope to learn as a result of my
incredibly \emph{expensive} education, some of which I will learn as a result
of my undying thirst for knowledge, and some of which I will endeavour to learn,
but never succeed. It will be updated as I learn or discover. Its purpose is to
outline all of the things that I feel I should know, as an engineer, and as an
inventor.
