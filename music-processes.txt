Creating an Album of Audiobook Chapters:
****************************************

    It's more convenient to have an album of separate audio files, each of
    which represents one chapter in the audiobook. The bash script at
    Git/Tools/chapter.sh is used to split an audiobook into chapters (one file
    for each chapter). However, this script does not set tag information for
    these files, and they are simply named based on the chapter that they
    contain. The script, if run with no arguments, will display usage
    information.

Renaming and Retagging Audiobooks:
**********************************

    After the split script has been used, it's important to retag and rename
    the files to be more easily recognized by the media serving application.
    The script to do this is Git/Tools/retag.sh. This script also will print
    usage information if invoked with no arguments, -h, or --help. This script
    takes a path to a directory containing a number of music files in the form
    "Chapter-XX.mp3" where "XX" is replaced with the chapter number. The script
    will incrementally play each one to allow the user to get the name of the
    chapter from the beginning of the file. Once the user has discovered the
    title, they may press ^C to quit playback. The script will then prompt for
    the title. The user enters the title, and then the script will set the
    tags in the mp3 file and rename the file accordingly. This will be done for
    all files in the directory that match the rules.
