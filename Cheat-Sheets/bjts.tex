% Theory of Operation:
%   - NPN, PNP structure and operation
%   - IV Characteristic
% Analysis:
%   - Lorge Signal (finding the Q-Point, load-line)
%   - Smol Signal (h-param model--medium band)
%   - Smol Signal (hybrid-pi model--low/high band)
% Non-Ideal Behaviors:
%   - Base Width Modulation
%   - Collector Breakdown (avalanche, punch-through)
%   - Reverse Leakage Current
% Applications:
%   - Biasing topographies
%   - As a switch
%   - As an amplifier
