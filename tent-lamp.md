# A Tent Chandelier #

This goal of this project is to design and build a compact, variable brightness
chandelier aimed at use in small tents. I came up with the idea as a convenient
lighting solution for when I'm out in the woods alone. Even though it isn't
programming related, I'm going to document the process and results here.
